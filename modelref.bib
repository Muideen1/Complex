    abstract = { Object-oriented programming is a suitable technique for representation of concepts and so is convenient for description of (computer) simulation models, as the description can be near to that of simulated systems. Dynamics of simulated systems is often subject to complex control rules with their support being one or more elements belonging to the same system. The description of behaviour of such elements needs often object-oriented representation of concepts that are applied in the control. These concepts belong to a ‘world viewing’ that is ontologically quite different from that used in the description of the simulated system. An extreme case is a simulation of a system that contains a controlling element that itself applies simulation for anticipating future consequences of the element decision. This paper is dedicated to application of languages that are not only object oriented but also process oriented and block oriented. Some existing and prepared applications are presented too. }
