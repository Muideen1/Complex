        abstract = {Query/Views/Transformation (QVT) is the OMG standard language for specifying model transformations in the context of MDA. It is regarded as one of the most important standards since model transformations are proposed as major operations for manipulating models. In the first part of the paper we briefly summarize the typical transformation scenarios that developers encounter in software development and formulate key requirements for each scenario. This allows a comparison between the desirable and the formulated requirements for QVT. Such a comparison helps us to initially evaluate the adequacy of the QVT language.The second part of the paper focuses on the current state of the standard: the language architecture, specification, paradigm, and open issues. The three QVT sublanguages Operational Mappings, Relations, and Core are briefly described. Special attention is given to the currently available and expected tool support.}
